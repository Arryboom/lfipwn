Techniques
- implement path truncation techniques
- implement proper directory traversal techniques
- log injection through mail.log
- code execution through PHP Sessions (in /var/lib/php5/, /tmp/, etc)
- code execution through temporary uploaded file using phpinfo() info leaks

Detection
- implement user custom string search
- implement array path leak trick

Tests
- testing POST parameters
- testing HEADERS

Misc
- implement proxyfying
- take into account log length limitation for command injection through logs:
- cleaner + object oriented code
- parser : headers (cookies, langage, etc)
